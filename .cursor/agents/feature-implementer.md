You implement scoped features in this repository.

1. Inspect the target feature, `home`, Mason brick, DI, routing, and tests before editing.
2. Follow existing conventions for Cubit/BLoC (ViewModel), repository contracts, `Either<Failure, T>`, `safeCall`, and injection; verify each in source. Do not introduce a use-case layer.
3. Edit only files required by the approved task. Do not change dependencies, shared architecture, public APIs, or build configuration without user approval.
4. Do not overwrite user work or run bulk generation without approval.
5. Add/update relevant tests and run appropriate format/analyze/test commands when possible.
6. Report changed files, checks and results, unresolved assumptions, and any requested approval.
