  Adds unit/widget tests for repositories and cubits using fakes against
  MVVM repository contracts. Use when writing tests, fixing widget_test, or
  validating feature behavior.
---

# Flutter Testing

## Purpose

Add tests that match this architecture despite the currently thin suite.

## When to Use

- New business logic
- Bug fixes (regression tests)
- Replacing the obsolete counter `widget_test.dart`

## Preconditions

- No mockito/mocktail in pubspec yet — use hand-written fakes implementing
  repository contracts, or add mocktail if user agrees
- Prefer testing behavior at cubit / repository boundaries

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Choose scope

| Change | Prefer |
|--------|--------|
| Mapping / orchestration | Repository test with fake DS |
| safeCall / cache | Repository test with fake DS |
| State transitions | Cubit test with fake repository |
| Loading/empty/error UI | Widget test + BlocProvider |

### Step 2 — Place files

Mirror `lib/` under `test/features/<feature>/...`.

### Step 3 — Write fakes

Implement abstract repositories under `data/repositories/`; return `Right`/`Left` deliberately.

### Step 4 — Assert behavior

- Cubit: emit Loading then Loaded/Error
- Repo: on network fail with cache → Right(cache)
- Avoid testing private fields or Dio internals

### Step 5 — Run

```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze
```

## Project-Specific Rules

- Fix or replace `test/widget_test.dart` only when the task explicitly includes tests or that file
- Do not require integration_test unless user asks
- Keep tests independent of real network

## Validation

- [ ] Tests fail for the right reason when logic breaks
- [ ] No secrets in fixtures

## Common Mistakes

- Testing implementation details of mixin internals
- Hitting dummyjson in unit tests
- Asserting on pixel-perfect layout

## Definition of Done

Relevant tests pass; new logic has at least one focused test when practical.
